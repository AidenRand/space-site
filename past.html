    <h2>THE PAST OF SPACE FLIGHT</h2>
</div>

    <div class="page-body">
        <h3>SPUTNIK 1</h3>
        <p>On October 4, 1957 the first ever object made by humans was launched into space. This object
            was no other than Sputnik 1, Sputnik was manufactured by the USSR on October 4, 1957 during a period of
            political hostility between the two superpowers of the Soviet Union and the United States.
            Sputnik was launched atop an R7 rocket, the satellite was able to transmit beeps from a radio
            onboard so everyone around the world knew it was truly in orbit. This created great fear in the
            America because at the time, The two countries had been competing to create intercontinental
            balistic missiles which would be capable of sending a nuke that would take 30 minutes to travel
            over seas.  After the successful launch of sputnik 1 the USSR launched Sputnik 2 on November 3, 1957
            which was the first first to carry living animal, a Soviet space pup named Laika. Sadly Laika passed
            away on the fourth orbit due to overheating caused by an air conditioning malfunction.

          <h3>EXPLORER</h3>
          <p>Prior to the launch of Sputnik 1 the united states developed there own satellite called
            Explorer. After 2 failed launch attempts they succeeded, The sattelite was launched by 
            the Jupiter C (Juno) rocket developed from a German V2 rocket. This feat was made possible by a 
            team of mostly German engineers lead by Wernher von Braun. Explorer successfully launched 
            on January 31, 1958 making it the first ever American artificial satellite launched into space.
            Explorer carried several scientific instruments aboard included a geiger counter used to detect
            cosmic rays. This was for an experiment lead by James Van Allen, which combined with the 
            measurements from later satellites lead to the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts 
            which are two belts made up of cosmic radiation and high energy particles that originate 
            from the sun and become trapped in Earths magnetic field. In 1958 the activities of 
            exploring space were put into a new government agency, the National Aronautics and
            Space Administration (NASA).

          <h3>HUMANS IN SPACE</h3>
          <p>The day of April 12, 1961 History was made as the russian cosmonaut Yuri Gargarin
            was the first human being to orbit the Earth. The flight lasted 108 minutes, and 
            just over three weeks later the American astronaut Alan Shepard was launched into 
            space on a suborbital trajectory. Unlike orbit, a suborbital flight does not go all
            the way around the Earth. Alan Shepard's flight lasted a total of 15 minutes.
          </p>

          <h3>FIRST MAN</h3>
          <p>On July 16, 1969 the saturn V took off from Cape canaveral, this was the beginning
            of a 3 day mission to the moon. Those onboard include Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and
            Mike Collins. On July 24, 1969 Everything would change, This was the day the first ever human
            being would ever step foot on the moon. As Neil Armstrong stepped down that ladder
            and families huddled around the TV, history was being made. "One small step for man,
            One giant leap for mankind", this quote will live on forever as a reminder of that 
            historic day.

            <h3>THE END OF AN ERA</h3>
            <p>After the NASA canceled the apollo program after the last lunar landing of
              apollo 17, human space flight was confined to low Earth orbit. These missions 
              were carried out by the space shuttles. The International Space Station, hubble 
              telescope and many other objects were put into orbit with these shuttles. they 
              also brought astronauts to and from the ISS but the Space shuttle program was 
              also canceled in 2011 after two of the worst disasters in space flight history. The first
              was the Challenger disaster on July 28, 1986 that was caused by a failure of the two 
              O-ring seals between the two lower portions of the the right-hand solid rocket booster, 
              causing the spacecraft to fall apart just 73 seconds into it's launch, all 7 astronauts on 
              board were killed. The second disaster took place on Febuary 1, 2003 during the rentry of the
              columbia space shuttle. The shuttle was in space for 16 days but during there re entry there 
              was a malfunction with the heat shield and the shuttle disintegrated from the heat from friction
              of entering the atmosphere, Sadly all 7 astronauts died. This marked the end of the space shuttle 
              program and left America with no way to send astronauts to space.
