    <h2>THE FUTURE OF SPACE FLIGHT</h2>
</div>

<div class="page-body">
  <h3>THIS TIME TO STAY</h3>
  <p>In the year 2025 NASA plan to create a permament base on the surface of the moon.
    This base will be used to conduct tests and also mine ice near the poles where the mission
    will be landing. This ice can be used for many things including making liquid fuel for rockets
    using the hydrogen and oxygen in the ice. The ice can also be used as drinking water and for crops
    if they are grown.  Mining ice on the moon will open an entirely new realm of possibilites for space 
    travel. Since we would be able to make the fuel on the moon and use the moons recourses to create
    structures, the moon would ask as a gas station to enable further journeys to planets like mars and 
    beyond. The purpose of these missions is to prepare for missions to mars.

    <h3>LIVING ON MARS</h3>
    <p>The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to become a multi planet species and that begins with 
      creating a self sustainable colony on Mars. Everything that we have done in human space 
      exploration would lead to the very moment that the first human being steps foot on martian
      soil. This will be no easy feat, but the point of the Artemis missions is to see if we can
      make the small step of creatin a sustainable base on mars before we make the leap to Mars.
      Nasa plans on launching astronats to mars by the late 2030's to early 2040's. On the other
      hand SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says manned missions will reach mars by 2030. This will be the 
      ultimate challenge and we will all  have to come together to make it possible.

      <h3>BEYOND MARS</h3>
      <p>After or even before Mars there or many things we can do. Some of the things include
        looking more into one Jupiters moons Europa which surface is made up of water ice 
        and scientists have found strong evidence to support the idea that Europa also has
        oceans beneath it's frigid upper layer. these oceans could be perfect for the formation of
        life and also creating fuel for rockets. There are also many astroids around the solar
        system that also contain water that can be used as fuel depot, The liquid propellant 
        would be made by splitting the oxygen and hydrogen which are the two of the main ingredients
        for rocket fuel. This would mean that we would be able to go further and further as long as 
        there are asteroids, planets, or moons that contain water or water ice.
