      <h3>WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE</h3>
      <p>After the cancellation of the space shuttle program in 2011, America was left with no 
        way to send humans to space. NASA began to rely on Russia to taxi astronauts to and from 
        the space station in their Soyuz spacecraft.  Nasa was set to send astronauts to the ISS
        with soyuz until 2018.

        <h3>PRIVATE COMPANIES</h3>
        <p>Since the start of the 21st century we have seen a growth in the number of private
          space companies including SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic. These companies 
          would be the beginning of a new era of space travel. The goal that Elon musk had when 
          creating SpaceX was to substantially reduce the overall price to build and launch rockets.
          After 3 failed attempts to successfully launch SpaceX's falcon 1 rocket they had barely
          enough money and parts to produce a fourth rocket. If this launch failed it would mean 
          the end of SpaceX entirely, The launch was successful and this achievement resulted in 
          a contract worth $1.6 billion from NASA to make 12 supply missions to the ISS. On May 30,
          2020 SpaceX would launch 2 astronauts to the International space station. Now after 9 
          years America was capable of sending it's own astronauts to space with no outside help.

          <h3>BACK TO THE MOON</h3>
          <p>As this is being written Artemis 1 has just reached the launch pad 39B. The plan for 
            this launch is to fly an uncrewed mission around the moon to collect radiation data and
            engineering data to assess the readiness of the SLS and Orion spacecraft's ability to
            to carry humans. this mission will last more than a month and will be the start of a 
            new journey in human space travel.
